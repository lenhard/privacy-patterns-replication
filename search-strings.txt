IEEExplore
============================================

IEEExplore had a hard upper limit regarding the number of search terms allowed in a query. To deal with this limitation, we step-wise tested the different terms for synonyms of patterns and removed terms that did not yield additional results. The query listed here returns complete results regarding our search terms and IEEExplore.
